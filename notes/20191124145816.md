# Preact Router

#js #frontend #preact

A simple URL-based router for Preact. The baseline is a simple import `import Router from 'preact-router';`

Usage:

```JSX
<Router>
 <Home path="/" />
 <About path="/about" />
 // Advanced is an optional query
 <Search path="/search/:query/:advanced?" />
</Router>
```

Query parameters marked with `:` are added as props to the component.

There is an option for lazy loading with `AsyncRoute`.

It supports hash history using:

```import { createHashHistory } from 'history';

const Main = () => (
    <Router history={createHashHistory()}>`
```

This gives us `url/#path` styled links, which helps with cases, where the browser would navigate to a resource, instead of leaving the handling to us.
